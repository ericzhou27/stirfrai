# This file includes the minimal list of direct dependencies.
# requirements.txt includes all pinned direct and transitive dependencies.
# Only edit this file, not requirements.txt directly.
# After editing, run the following to pin the dependencies to particular
# versions:
#
#   pip freeze | xargs pip uninstall -y
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip freeze | grep -v en-core-web-sm > requirements-freeze.txt
#
# Also update the versions in the manual installation steps in pre-commit.sh.
#
# Check that everything works because the versions might be upgraded.
